# Climate Action Hackathon 2025 — One‑Page Website

A simple, semantic, and responsive site aligned with **SDG 13: Climate Action**.

## What’s inside
- Header with navigation (About • SDG 13 • Event • Register)
- About section with SDG 13 figure
- SDG 13: examples (heatwave tech, early warnings, water safety)
- Event timeline (May–Aug 2025 promotion & training; **Aug 15, 2025** nomination)
- Speakers (4 profiles)
- Tracks & Challenges (heat, flood, green infra, community apps)
- Resources link
- Registration form (Name, Email, Role, Interest)
- Sponsors & Partners logo grid
- Footer with social links (X, Facebook) and SDG link

## How to run
No build tools.
1. Keep the files together:
   ```
   index.html
   style.css
   img/
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customize
- Colors & spacing: edit CSS variables in `style.css` (`:root`).
- Text/images: update content in `index.html`.
- Add speakers/tracks: duplicate list/card items in their sections.

## Accessibility (basics)
- Semantic HTML (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- Skip link to main content
- Visible focus outline
- Targets account for sticky header (smooth in‑page jumps)

## Sponsors/Partners logos
Logos are auto‑sized in a balanced grid. Keep images inside `img/`; they will scale with `max-height/width` so different logo sizes look consistent.

## Project structure
```
index.html   # content & sections
style.css    # layout, tokens, components
img/         # SDG and sponsor/partner images
```
